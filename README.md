#pydruid
pydruid exposes a simple API to create, execute, and analyze [Druid](http://druid.io/) queries. pydruid can parse query results into [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame objects for subsequent data analysis -- this offers a tight integration between [Druid](http://druid.io/), the [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html) stack (for scientific computing) and [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (for machine learning). Additionally, pydruid can export query results into TSV or JSON for further processing with your favorite tool, e.g., R, Julia, Matlab, Excel.
